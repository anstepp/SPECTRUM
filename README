SPECTRUM instrument

A saw wave detuner. It also allows for onset envelope control.

p0 = start
p1 = duration
p2 = amplitude
p3 = base frequency
p4 = number of partials
p5 = detuning table
p6 = onset table
p7 = seed
p8 = pan

p2 (amplitude), p3 (base frequency), p5 (detuning table),
p6 (onset table), and p8 (panning) can recieve update
information from a table.
