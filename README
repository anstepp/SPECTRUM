SPECTRUM instrument

A saw wave detuner. It also allows for onset envelope control.

p0 = start
p1 = duration
p2 = amplitude
p3 = base frequency
p4 = number of partials
p5 = detuning table
p6 = onset table
p7 = seed
p8 = pan

SPECTRUM takes a defined number of partials [p4] to
create an additive oscillator bank. You can then detune
this table over time using the detuning table [p5] to
detune the partials logarithmically. That is, the amount
of detuning is the same in pitch terms, but not in Hz. Each
partial is randomly selected to go up or down, to get a
different set of directions, change the seed [p7].

p2 (amplitude), p3 (base frequency), p5 (detuning table),
p6 (onset table), and p8 (panning) can recieve update
information from a table.
